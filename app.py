Proposed Solution
The proposed solution involves building a GenAI Evaluation Workbench tailored for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). This workbench will perform evaluations using both online and offline agents, analyzing patterns and presenting objective and subjective metrics. This tool will cater to different teams such as Business, Developers, and Quality Engineering (QE), supporting GenAI app development and testing.
Key components of the solution:

Prompt Engineer Agent: Suggests prompt variations and fine-tunes hyperparameters (like temperature, top-p, top-k) based on input data.
Data Analysis Agent: Recommends sample sizes based on confidence intervals and generates evaluation datasets for different user groups.
Intelligent Evaluator Agent: Provides objective (e.g., F1 score, accuracy) and subjective (e.g., relevance, robustness) metrics to rank and judge model output.
The tool generates evaluation reports, helping teams assess if the GenAI solution is ready for approval by key stakeholders (e.g., LRC, MRM).
Benefits
Primary Business Objective:
To streamline the evaluation process of GenAI applications, ensuring that solutions meet the necessary approval criteria from internal stakeholders (LRC, MRM) before going to market.
Business Benefits:
Facilitates faster evaluations of GenAI models, improving development timelines.
Provides clarity and transparency in the approval process by generating detailed evaluation reports.
Reduces the risk of rejection by aligning model evaluations with past approved project outcomes.
KPIs:
Time reduction in approval processes.
Success rate of model approvals by LRC/MRM.
Number of iterations required to achieve model approval.
Accuracy of predictions (e.g., success probability of model approval).
Impact:
This workbench will enable more structured and efficient GenAI evaluations, resulting in faster approval, reduced development cycles, and better decision-making regarding product launches. It will reduce time spent in resubmissions and iterations by providing early insights on the likelihood of approval.
Feasibility
Technical Feasibility:
The workbench is technically feasible as it involves leveraging existing GenAI tools and methods (such as prompt engineering and evaluation metrics) to evaluate LLMs. The implementation of agents is achievable with the right combination of data engineering, machine learning, and reporting frameworks.
Complexity:
The workbench requires managing multiple layers of evaluations (objective and subjective), integrating past project data, and generating approval likelihood predictions. However, given the clarity of the defined agent roles and modular architecture, the complexity is manageable.
Risks & Dependencies:
Risks: Potential challenges include aligning evaluations with stakeholder (LRC/MRM) expectations, ensuring the reliability of past project data, and the dynamic nature of LLM performance.
Dependencies: Successful implementation will depend on the availability of historical evaluation data and the ability to map model outcomes with past project approvals. Integrating this tool with existing evaluation and reporting processes may also require coordination across teams.
