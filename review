Deeper understanding of ML Models:
Enhance knowledge of different ML models, their strengths/weaknesses, and evaluation metrics to design better test scenarios and validate outputs effectively.
2. Agentsâ€™ working model and testing best practices:
Gain deeper expertise in agent-based systems, including their workflows, dependencies, and testing approaches, to ensure robust and reliable implementations.
3. Test Automation & Coverage Improvement:
Focus on increasing automated test coverage for ML models and agent workflows. Measure progress via metrics like % of automated test cases, reduction in manual test effort, and defect detection rate.
4. Performance & Reliability Testing Metrics:
Develop skills to measure and evaluate model/agent performance under various scenarios (load, response time, edge cases). Track metrics such as response accuracy, latency, and error r
