🧱 1. Replace Text Blocks with Icons + Short Labels:
Use icons + titles like:

Phase	Icon	Label
Pre-Processing	🧪	Test Data Shared (Dev/QA)
Triggering Bot	🎯	Manual Trigger (Orchestrator)
Initial Bot Steps	📥	Create Queue, Validate Files
Bot Processing	🤖	Manual E2E, Screenshots Only
Output	📤	Manual vs Bot – NAS Output
🟨 2. Visual Box for Challenges:
A sidebar or colored box (e.g., orange or red) titled “Key Challenges” with icons:

❗ Limited test data
🧾 Manual regression testing
🕵️ No monitoring or log validation
📉 Only negative test cases
⏳ No load testing support
🧩 3. Footer Box (Optional):
Add a box:
“What’s Missing?” or “Improvements TBD”
with:

✅ Monitoring/Logs
✅ Load handling
✅ Auto email validation
✅ Expand E2E test coverage


❗ Limited Test Data
Testing is limited to a small, predefined set of documents.

📧 Business Exception Emails
Failure emails are sent, but logging and subjects are not validated.

🧾 Manual Regression Testing
All regression test cases are executed manually.

🔁 Partial E2E Testing
Only core functional flows are tested; broader scenarios are not covered.

⚠️ Minimal Negative Testing
Negative test cases are very limited in scope.

🕵️ No Monitoring or Logging
No support for real-time monitoring or systematic log validation.

📉 No Load Testing Support
System does not support increased load or stress testing scenarios.

🔍 Logs Verification TBD
Log checking at each step is not yet implemented (planned for future)
