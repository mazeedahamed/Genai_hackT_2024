⚙️ Prompt-Specific Testing Complexity: Custom logic needed per model; hard to scale reusable testing.
🧠 Model-Specific Behavior Validation: Isolation of model versions and consistent behavior validation was complex.
📊 Accuracy Reports for LRC/MRM: Automating scoring aligned with ground truth was non-trivial.
🚀 Performance Evaluation Gaps: Measuring latency, cost, and throughput under realistic loads.
📅 Quarterly Accuracy Reporting (MRM): Manual collation and version drift detection challenges.
