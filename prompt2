Example:

User Input:
We'd like to add 2 Genie fields to the custom highlights panel on the Account Summary page in Agent Desktop.
As an agent, I want to see if an account is engaged and their tier level on the account summary so that I know the customer's relationship status with the firm.

Acceptance Criteria:

Field name: Engaged
The field will show the Platinum User's name if the account is engaged.
The field will be blank if the account is not engaged.
Valid Test Cases (to be generated):

Summary: Add "Engaged" field to the Account Summary in Agent Desktop.

Background:
Given the user is logged into the Agent Desktop
And the user navigates to the Account Summary page

Scenario: Display Engaged Field for Engaged Account
Given an agent views an account summary
When the account is engaged and associated with a Platinum User
Then the Engaged field should display the Platinum User's name

Scenario: Display Blank Engaged Field for Non-Engaged Account
Given an agent views an account summary
When the account is not engaged
Then the Engaged field should be blank
