Additionally, he invested in Smith Sports Academy, a privately owned training facility that generates revenue. However, the NFL and Chicago Hawks themselves did not directly contribute to his wealth but were rather entities involved in his career.

Invalid Parties:

❌ Chicago Hawks (A sports team, not a direct wealth contributor)

Smith has accumulated wealth through strategic real estate investments. He owns multiple commercial properties through Summit Realty Group, a private real estate firm managing his assets. One of his major acquisitions includes an office complex purchased from Stonebridge Holdings, a private development company specializing in commercial real estate.

Additionally, Smith invested in residential projects under Pinecrest Estates, a company focused on high-value housing developments. These ventures have significantly contributed to his overall financial growth.

However, certain entities referenced in real estate transactions are not valid parties. For instance, references to Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of the Interior, or National Park Service are invalid as they are U.S. Government entities and do not directly contribute to Smith’s wealth.
