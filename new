we have 3 phases in a module 
1. Using additional LLMS and python libraries we are extracting the different score as per the Recomended metrics for the use case like subjective like completeness, truthfulness etc / objective like Bleu, meteor, ter, bert etc/ safety like haluzination, toxicity, Bias etc
2. Using open ai with the concept of chain poll. That goes through the series of interrogation with the model's own response and creates a score.
3. Score Aggregator module : this module internally uses Completions open ai, combines both the Point 1 and 2 outputs and then generates a score for each metrics. But here the module will have more priority on the metrics calculation. 

this module is a part of my patent that I am filing
give me a nice write up everything should be non-obvious


**Evaluation (Metrics/Prompt Synthesis) Architecture Diagram**  

This slide outlines the architecture for evaluating and ranking prompts based on various metrics and techniques. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its components:  

---

### **1. Input Metrics**  
- **Recommended Metrics**: Predefined metrics suggested based on industry standards and best practices.  
- **User-Selected Metrics**: Metrics chosen by the user to meet specific preferences or requirements.  
- **AI Pattern & Business Use Case Descriptions**: Provides context or domain-specific details for prompt evaluation.  

---

### **2. Custom Metric Weightage Technique**  
This component focuses on prioritizing metrics through weighting:  
- **Cluster Analysis**:  
  - Utilizes techniques like **K-Mean** or **Hierarchical Clustering** to group similar metrics or prompts.  
  - Forms two clusters:  
    - **Evaluated Metrics Cluster**: Represents relevant and effective metrics.  
    - **User Input Cluster**: Reflects user-defined preferences for metrics.  
- **Dynamic Prompt Synthesis**:  
  - Leverages the **OpenAI Completion API** for generating or refining prompts dynamically.  
  - Aligns with the **Dynamic Preference of Objective/Subjective/Safety Metrics Group** to ensure balanced evaluations across categories.  

---

### **3. Weighted Metrics Summary Generator**  
- **Chunking**: Divides the evaluation process into smaller, manageable parts.  
- **Dynamic Prompt Synthesis**: Dynamically generates or optimizes prompts for evaluation.  
- **Completion API**: Facilitates automated prompt generation and evaluation using AI.  

---

### **4. Scoring**  
- **Final Objective Scores**:  
  - Uses metrics like BLEU, BERT, and METEOR to measure the objective quality of prompts.  
- **Final Subjective Scores**:  
  - Evaluates attributes such as fluency, completeness, and consistency.  
- **Final Safety Scores**:  
  - Ensures prompts are free of bias, hallucinations, toxicity, or unsafe content.  
- **Generated Metrics of All Prompts**:  
  - Includes directive, subjective, expertise-affirming, and user-specific prompts for comprehensive evaluation.  

---

### **5. Score Aggregation and Feedback**  
- **Score Aggregator Module**:  
  - Compiles scores from objective, subjective, and safety categories for a unified evaluation.  
- **Feedback Loop**:  
  - Continuously refines prompts based on evaluation results, ensuring iterative improvement.  

---

### **6. Output**  
- **Prompt Ranking**:  
  - Ranks prompts based on aggregated scores to identify the best-performing ones.  
- **Detailed Evaluation Report**:  
  - Provides a comprehensive PDF report summarizing all evaluations, scores, and rankings.

This module delivers a structured, automated approach to prompt evaluation, ensuring they align with objective, subjective, and safety benchmarks while meeting user-defined requirements. It leverages clustering, AI-based synthesis, and advanced scoring mechanisms for optimization and continuous improvement.
